# Object Classification in Urban Aerial Drone Footage
Object classification in urban aerial drone footage presents unique challenges due to occlusions, varying scales, and dense environments. This project utilizes the 2019 VisDrone dataset, a large-scale benchmark for drone-based vision tasks, to develop and evaluate deep learning models for object classification. We explore region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to classify objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, and bicycles in complex urban settings. We intend to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in real-world aerial surveillance applications.
