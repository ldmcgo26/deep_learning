            Wildlife Detection With Drones
             - Images of different wildlife in
                various habitats
             - SE-YOLO model: Effective for
                classifying small targets
Previous
            Stanford Drone Dataset
Solutions    - Video data of bikers,
                pedestrians, cars, etc…
             - Goal: Target trajectory
                forecasting - Predict social
                etiquettes and common sense
                behavior

          VisDrone Challenge
           - Annual challenge held by Tianjin University
              and has become a standard benchmark in
              drone-based object detection
           - Each year, datasets include footage from
              various Chinese urban and rural settings
           - Example: 2019 Challenge
Dataset       ~300 videos
              ~260,000 frames
              ~10,000 images

Challenges
             -   Merging multiple datasets
             1) Choosing the right model for
                specific object detection task
             - YOLO
             - R-CNN
             - Zero Shot
Next Steps
             1) Customize Data Loader to prep
                images for chosen architecture
